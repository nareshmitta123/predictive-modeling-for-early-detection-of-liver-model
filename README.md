 Liver is the most important organ in the human body .When liver diseases are found in their advanced stages, there is no way to treat the patient. On the other hand, the patient can take precautions if the illnesses are identified in their early stages. By finding liver disease in early stage, one can assist the patient undertake the necessary precautions, as liver disorders are typically discovered at an advanced stage when they canâ€™t be of any value to the user.The proposed model is created using random forest algorithm with deep learning approach which will help to find the more accurate and efficient way to predict the outcome. The random forest technique extends the bagging approach by combining bagging and feature randomness to generate an uncorrelated forest of decision trees. Feature randomness, also known as feature bagging, generates a random collection of features, resulting in low correlation among decision trees. The existing model was created using various machine learning algorithms in which the accuracy is given as 70\% to 75\% . The result of the proposed model is to create a model with a more accurate and efficient model which will be helpful for the prediction of the liver disorders.
